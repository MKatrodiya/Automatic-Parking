# Automatic-Parking
A simulation-based automatic parking solution using reinforcement learning, applicable to single agent environments.

## Problem
Parking in poses unique challenges to drivers, requiring
precise maneuvering in limited space and creativity navigating
through spaces without strict road guidelines. Automated park-
ing is mandatory to achieve full end-to-end self driving (FSD)
but is often viewed as a convenience because a decreased
danger level relative to road navigation. The demand for
improved automatic parking systems will increase alongside
FSD adoption rates. Automated parking systems also open
the door for collaborative parking agents, in contrast to the
traditionally competitive nature of parking.

This project seeks to develop a self-driving parking algo-
rithm in a simulated environment that is extensible to multi-
agent collaboration.
